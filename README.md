# red-dot-app

Red. is a social media where blood recipients meet blood donors. The blood donor has decreased over time during COVID-19 period due to many reasons. But, lives need to be reconnected with blood and Red. is bridging the gap. Blood recipients could simply post the blood requirement. The Red. app will show the request on the feed and send notification to the closest proximity blood donor user. The blood donor will be rewarded with points once the blood donation is done.
